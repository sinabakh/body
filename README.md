# body ðŸ‘…ðŸ’¨ðŸ¤

Checks the color of the tongue and the head. If the tongue was red the head was green, the head will be beheaded!

This story began [here in Twitter](https://twitter.com/mamal72/status/820339540040753152).

## How It Works
Compile it:

```
ghc body.hs
```

Then Run it as `./body {Tongue Color} {Head Color}`.

```
./body red green
```
